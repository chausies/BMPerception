			<p>
				Welcome! You will be given a series of 96 tasks (part 1), a quick
				survey (part 2), and then another series of 96 tasks (part 3). The
				whole process should take only about 25 minutes.
			</p>

			<h2>Instructions for part 1</h2>

			<p>
				For each task, you will see a <b>black figure</b> walking left or right
				for a few seconds. <b>As fast as you can</b> during this time, press the
				left arrow key (←) if you think it's moving left or the right arrow key
				(→) if you think it's moving right. Soon after, you will briefly see a
				<b>white figure</b> either walking or running. After this, please choose
				whether you think it was walking or running. You will do 96 tasks like
				this.
			</p>
			<p>
				Lastly, throughout each task, there will be a <b>red dot</b> in the
				center of the screen. <b>Please keep your eyes focused on that red dot
				at all times</b> while doing the tasks.
			</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>
				When you've understood the instructions and are ready to begin,
				please click the "Ready" button. After 1 example task, you'll go
				straight to doing the 96 tasks of part 1.
			</p>

			<h2>Instructions for part 3</h2>

			<p>
			Part 3 is just like Part 1, except now, you <b>only</b> focus on the
			white figure. <b>Ignore</b> the black figure, and try your best to
			tell whether the white figure is running or walking. Again, make sure
			to <b>always</b> keep your eyes focused on the red dot in the center
			<b>at all times</b>.
			</p>

				When you've understood the instructions and are ready to begin,
