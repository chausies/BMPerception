		<p>
			Welcome! You will be given a series of 96 tasks (part 1), a quick
			survey (part 2), and then another series of 96 tasks (part 3). The
			whole process should take only about 25 minutes.
		</p>

		<h2>Instructions for part 1</h2>

		<p>
			For each task, you will see a <b>black figure</b> walking left or right
			for a few seconds. <b>As fast as you can</b> during this time, press the
			left arrow key (←) if you think it's moving left or the right arrow key
			(→) if you think it's moving right. Soon after, you will briefly see a
			<b>white figure</b> either walking or running. After this, please choose
			whether you think it was walking or running. You will do 96 tasks like
			this.
		</p>
		<p>
			Lastly, throughout each task, there will be a <b>red dot</b> in the
			center of the screen. <b>Please keep your eyes focused on that red dot
			at all times</b> while doing the tasks.
		</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>
			When you've understood the instructions and are ready to begin, please click the "Ready" button. After 1 example task, you'll go straight to doing the 96 tasks of part 1.
